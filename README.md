# 🥊 FightCam – AI-Powered Motion Control for PC Games

**FightCam** is an open-source, Python-based **webcam motion controller SDK** that lets you control your favorite PC games using just your body movements — no extra hardware needed.

> Built by **Bhanu Yadav** and **Sushant Rana** during a hackathon project focused on innovation, accessibility, and hands-free interaction.

---

## 🎮 What It Does

- 🧠 Uses **MediaPipe** for real-time body tracking.
- 📷 Captures gestures using your **webcam**.
- ⌨️ Maps movements to **keyboard inputs** using `pydirectinput`.

With FightCam, you can:
- Punch, kick, jump, crouch — **all through motion**.
- Play any keyboard-mappable PC game (like Tekken, Mortal Kombat, etc).
- Build **interactive games or prototypes** using physical gestures.
- Explore **accessibility use-cases** for gaming and rehab.
